Project Title:
ASCII Pattern Generator

Overview of the Project:
This project is an interactive, menu-based Python application for generating and displaying various ASCII art patterns in the terminal. It is organized into separate modules for each pattern type, making the code clean, modular, and easy to maintain. This project provides a fun introduction to basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and recursion through a creative terminal interface.

Features:
Diamond pattern generator
Spiral pattern generator
Fractal tree pattern generator
Circle pattern generator
Easy-to-use interactive menu
Separate file/module for each pattern

Technologies/Tools Used:
Python 3.x
Standard Python libraries (no third-party packages)
Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals/command prompts
Developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any Python IDE

Steps to Install & Run the Project:
Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in VS Code or your preferred editor.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the command: python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions in the menu to generate patterns.

Instructions for Testing:
Start the program by running python main.py from the terminal.
Select any pattern from the menu and provide the input parameters when prompted (for example, size or depth).
Check that the correct ASCII art is displayed for each option.
Repeat for all available patterns to ensure functionality.

Optionally, compare your terminal output to known examples to validate correctness.
