Problem Statement:
Many beginner programmers struggle to find engaging projects that reinforce basic programming concepts such as loops, recursion, and modularity. Creating visual outputs in the terminal using ASCII art provides an enjoyable way to learn these skills and encourages experimentation.

Scope of the Project:
This project focuses on generating multiple types of ASCII art patterns interactively in the terminal. It covers four distinct patterns (diamond, spiral, fractal tree, and circle), each implemented in a separate Python module. The project is not designed for complex graphics, image conversion, or web-based display, but for educational and demonstrative use within a command-line environment.

Target Users:
Students learning introductory Python or programming
Educators seeking simple, interactive coding assignments
Anyone interested in creative terminal art and exploring recursion and loops in code
Coding clubs and beginner workshops

High-Level Features:
Interactive menu-driven interface for selecting and generating patterns
Four separate ASCII pattern modules: diamond, spiral, fractal tree, and circle
Prompts user for simple parameters (size, depth, radius) to customize output
Clear separation of code into individual files for maintainability
No additional packages required; relies only on standard Python
